			"content": "<p>On February 9, 2010, my best friend, Joshua, and I set out on an adventure; the challenge we posed to ourselves was to read all 84 novels that had won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in one year. On March 19, 2015—a full 61 months and 87 books later—I finally wrapped up The Pulitzer Project.</p>\n<p>I didn’t cross that finish line with a shout or a even a sigh of relief, though; I crossed the finish line with, I have to confess, hesitation, reticence, and a touch of sorrow. Sure, there was a bit of relief mixed in there, but I’d be lying if I said that I had nothing but happiness to close the back cover of the last book and place it back on the shelf.</p>\n<p>The Pulitzer Project started out very ambitiously, and it became so much more than a mere reading project or a humble book club to me. It became a huge part of my life. In fact, it became an agent by which I measured major life events; I became homeless (a homelessness that would last for about a year and a half) while reading <em>The Fixer</em>; I was reading <em>A Death in the Family</em> when my uncle died, kicking off another whirlwind of familial drama; I was fighting a very real battle with a couple of churches that were burning me out on Calvinist theology while reading <em>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</em>; <em>March</em>, while moving in to a house in Kankakee County with my friend and reading partner, Joshua; <em>House Made of Dawn</em> while wrestling with entities not of this world in that house; I moved, again, to Evanston, Illinois while reading <em>The Age of Innocence</em> and I struggled living with the extremely wealthy who make up that city’s population while reading <em>The Collected Stories of John Cheever</em>; I met a pretty girl online while reading<em>The Shipping News</em>, then I married that girl a few years later just after I finished up <em>A Visit from the Goon Squad</em>; most recently, in the middle of <em>The Goldfinch</em>, that girl told me that I’m going to be a father before the end of this year.</p>\n<p>I did a lot of stuff over the course of this project, I lived in a lot of places, I worked at a lot of different jobs, I fought a lot of very personal battles and a few of them were pretty public, I met a lot of people, fell in love, got married, and became an expecting father. Of course “things change” when measured over the course of five years, but I’m almost an entirely different person than I was when I cracked the spine of the first Pulitzer-winning book I read back in February of 2010. The same is true for my reading compatriot, Joshua. He’s worked twice as many jobs as me, moved almost as many times as I did, fought many of the same battles I did, experienced a host of family tragedies, and he also recently learned he’s going to be a father (around the same time that my wife is due, actually).</p>\n<p>As much as we’ve changed, however, two things have remained constant over the past five years: this Pulitzer Project, and our friendship. And, when I think back on it, I wonder if that was kind of the underlying point of doing this project in the first place. We went into this project because we were a few years out of university, we were no longer in that collegiate mindset of reading books academically or critically, and we wanted to challenge ourselves with a set of novels to get back that place. While that did, in fact, happen, the project had an added benefit: it was a constant <em>something</em> that kept two very good friends tethered together in spite of an overwhelming amount of changes in both of their lives.</p>\n<p>Things change, people change, lives change, and the world spins madly on. There are lot of people in my life who, regrettably and unfortunately, went from being the very best of friends to mere acquaintances over the span of several years because we all changed; people got married, moved away, had kids, went to graduate school, became closer friends with other people… This kind of stuff happens all the time and it invariably happens to everybody to at least some extent. I think it’s a fair assumption that fate would have befallen Joshua and myself if not for The Pulitzer Project; no matter how much our lives changed, we had this thing that kept us always in communication with one another.</p>\n<p>That’s the real story of The Pulitzer Project. It wasn’t “two friends do something stupid for a long damn time,” it was “a reading challenge kept two friends close for a really long time.”</p>\n",

 Wrong.  I mean, have you read this blog before?  Since the birth of America, race has been used to structure, economic and political relationships.  Prior to the 1600&#8217;s race really wasn&#8217;t a thing.  People had and still have different cultures, but not different racial categories.  The first time the word race even appears in the English language is 1508, so the Ancient world did not  have the concept of different races.</p>\n<p>With the conquest of the Americas and a fresh addiction to sugar, European conquerers needs many hands to make the hard work of sugar, tobacco and cotton farming light.  But, since the America&#8217;s were little more than a handful of rough outposts, they couldn&#8217;t attract a voluntary workforce with crazy benefits like being allowed to live free and get paid.  Thus begins the transatlantic slave trade, one of the darkest events in all of human history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/slave-trade-map.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-1503 aligncenter\" src=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/slave-trade-map.jpg?w=676&#038;h=402\" alt=\"slave trade map\" width=\"676\" height=\"402\" /></a></p>\n<p>Race as a social construct was created essentially to protect this labor force.   Many laws&#8211;not just one&#8211;over hundreds of years were used to keep one class of people&#8211;black people&#8211;enslaved.  Politicians traded power for allowing the perpetuation of the institution of slavery, even our conflicted founding father Thomas Jefferson.  He wrote all men were created equal, but could not build the country he desired without those free hands to do the work.</p>\n<p>What would get good God fearing people to support the systematic violent oppression of their human brothers and sister? A story, a narrative that normalizes terror as truth.  At the center of the narrative was the concept that blacks were not humans, and therefore did not deserve human rights.  While the institution of slavery ended 7 generations ago, America still struggles to shake this narrative.</p>\n<p>Racism is supported by personal prejudice.  Individual beliefs about different groups of people perpetuate the kind of thinking that allows police to kill young people unchecked by the electorate.  But even if every person in America woke up tomorrow firmly antiracist in their heart, the laws that structure education, housing, economics, justice and other systems would still have racial bias in them.  Like a zombie&#8211;we may be the body, but if the zombie brain of racism lives, terror ensues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/michonne.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-1504 aligncenter\" src=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/michonne.jpg?w=477&#038;h=340\" alt=\"michonne\" width=\"477\" height=\"340\" /></a></p>\n<p>Over the centuries, hundreds if not thousands of people have tried to game the system by &#8220;passing&#8221;&#8211;taking on the identity of a race other than their own&#8211;mostly white.  Whites were able to be free, vote, own land&#8211;and slaves&#8211;and a host of other privileges that came with whiteness.  These privileges&#8211;which still exist in different ways today&#8211;helped keep people bought in to systems of oppression.  Black people willing to give up their culture and their ancestry could take on all the benefits of whiteness as long as they stayed hidden.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1507\" style=\"width: 298px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/1887-hemmings.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1507\" src=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/1887-hemmings.jpg?w=288&#038;h=393\" alt=\"Anita Florence Hemmings passed as white in oredr to attend Vassar in 1897\" width=\"288\" height=\"393\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Anita Florence Hemmings passed as white in order to attend Vassar in 1897</p></div>\n<p>Given our history of race and racism, and ignoring the self-hate of abdicating your culture, there were some legal and societal benefits people gained by passing as white&#8211;not the least of which was freedom.  But what could Rachel Dolezal possibly gain by passing as black?  Everything.</p>\n<p>In a country where whiteness is too often invisible to white people, Rachel wouldn&#8217;t be the first white girl to long to have a (different) culture.  No boring suburbia for her, Rachel takes cultural appropriation to a whole new level. No matter how many Mileys and Iggys try to beg ignorance, appropriation is real&#8211;and real simple to understand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/iceberg.gif\"><img class=\"  wp-image-1508 aligncenter\" src=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/iceberg.gif?w=383&#038;h=478\" alt=\"iceberg of culture\" width=\"383\" height=\"478\" /></a></p>\n<p>Imagine culture is an iceberg.  Certain parts of it are visible&#8211;food, dance, dress, festivals&#8211;while the foundation of what makes a culture are buried deep below the surface&#8211;beliefs, values rituals, shared lived realities and ways of being.  Millions of people of African decent, shipped abroad during the slave trade or settled here in America carved out a way of surviving , a way of being in the face of unstoppable cruelty, a way of thriving within a system built to destroy them.  The soul food, and the blues and the style and hip hop are the visible parts of the legacy of this ongoing struggle, but the deeper elements are essential to making sense of those expressions. Cultural appropriation is when you break off the top of the iceberg and wear it around like a costume.  You can dress up, dance, and even bite the rhymes of a culture&#8230;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/chvoctcusaa2gyl.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-1509 aligncenter\" src=\"https://smntks.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/chvoctcusaa2gyl.jpg?w=449&#038;h=305\" alt=\"CHVoCtcUsAA2GYL\" width=\"449\" height=\"305\" /></a></p>\n<p>But when you do, you leave behind the larger, more important part of culture: the deeply help beliefs, shared experiences, values, ancestry and destiny-the truth of what it means to be part of that group.  This part of the iceberg can&#8217;t be pulled out of the water and worn to the VMA&#8217;s.  They can&#8217;t be weaved onto your ends like Hawaiian silky.  They can&#8217;t belong to you, Rachel, or you either, Iggy.</p>\n<p>All of these women cover themselves in a carcass they call blackness made out of stereotypes, stolen hairstyles and narratives that they&#8217;ve nicked to make themselves feel cool, beautiful, feel like they are a part of something. At the same time their white privilege gives them entrance into public spheres often denied actual black women, taking their voice and supplanting it with a white fantasy version.</p>\n<p>And Rachel was a teacher, someone paid to tell other people how to think about and construct black femininity.  This is not how you love a culture&#8211;this is how you erase it.  Far from helping the community as some&#8211;including the NAACP&#8211;have suggested, her actions show the worst kind of white privilege&#8211;the privilege to define blackness with a white voice.</p>\n<p>(Be sure to read upcoming part 2 about the difference between transgender and transracial)</p>\n",

But by the time we left Kalofer, a village tucked away in Central Bulgaria, where the livestock population quite possibly outnumbers the number of humans living there, an impromptu farewell committee was wishing us adieu.</p>\n<p>As we rolled our bags out of town, over Kalofer’s bumpy roads spotted with droppings from the village’s numerous goat, cow, and horse residents, locals whom we’d not yet met popped their heads out over their fences exclaiming the equivalent of <em>Bon voyage</em> in Bulgarian.</p>\n<p>They waved goodbye, flashed wide smiles, and head bobbles that we’d determined to be customary in the region – gestures that are reminiscent of those we encountered in India.</p>\n<p>Our time in Kalofer had not been planned. We’d discovered the town accidentally while looking for accommodations nearby in Bulgaria’s second-largest city of <a href=\"http://triciaannemitchell.com/2014/07/30/bulgarian-national-revival-old-town-plovdiv-bulgaria/\" target=\"_blank\">Plovdiv</a>. Kalofer seemed to be appreciated among Bulgarians because of its proximity to Bulgaria’s famed lavender and <a title=\"The Roses of Bulgaria\" href=\"http://triciaannemitchell.com/2014/08/14/bulgarian-rose/\" target=\"_blank\">rose-growing fields</a>, its annual <a title=\"The Snowflake-Like Lace of Kalofer, Bulgaria\" href=\"http://triciaannemitchell.com/2014/09/07/kalofer-lace-bulgaria/\" target=\"_blank\">Lace Festival</a>, its well-groomed eco-trails, its monastery and convent, and its status as the birthplace of several national heroes and revolutionaries. It was also regarded as a town awash with tradition – one that was even able to retain Bulgarian customs despite nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule.</p>\n<p>Shawn and I had been seeking somewhere ‘authentic&#8217;, a quiet place in which we could catch up on projects. Rural Kalofer, in the shadows of the <em>Stara Planina</em> mountain range, seemed to fit the bill. Little did we know then that its 3,000 or so residents would serendipitously show us all the Bulgarian culture that we had been seeking. From <a title=\"A Lesson in Making Yogurt in Kalofer, Bulgaria\" href=\"http://triciaannemitchell.com/2014/07/23/how-to-make-yogurt-recipe-bulgarian-yogurt/\" target=\"_blank\">making homemade yogurt</a> and watching the distilling of brandy, we learned much about Bulgarian cuisine. We also had the opportunity to soak up Bulgarian arts as women spun lace and young musicians played folk tunes on bagpipes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Homemade Booties, Jam, &amp; Brandy: The Kindness of Strangers</h3>\n<p>In Kalofer, we found ourselves touched by the generosity of strangers. Our guesthouse owners filled our arms with flowers and succulent, homegrown tomatoes. Market vendors tossed complimentary zucchini, mini peppers, and carrots into our bag after we’d made our weekly purchases. Several motorists even pulled their cars onto roadsides, to offer us rides when we were out for a walk.</p>\n<p>Our first night in Kalofer, we took to the town’s sleepy residential streets, wanting to get a lay of the land and the town’s logistical offerings. We spotted a pair of cows wandering the streets solo, munching on goodies they’d unearthed in garbage cans.</p>\n<p>Heading to a <em>Magasin</em> (mini market), we encountered a group of four grandmothers, known as <em>babas</em> in Bulgarian. They were seated outside a brick home, some with canes in hand. They were gossiping, watching the livestock go by, waiting for the summer sun to slumber. We remarked that they’d likely known each other since childhood.</p>\n<p>“<em>Dobar den</em>,” Shawn and I said, pulling out a pair of words we’d amassed from our scant Bulgarian-language arsenal. “Good day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At this, the grandmothers could not contain themselves. They waved their hands enthusiastically, and tossed out sentences chock-full of unknown Slavic words, as if we had native proficiency of Bulgarian. The granny whom we deemed to have the strongest personality waved her cane in the air to make her points, as her companions giggled. We privately nicknamed her the ‘Alpha Baba&#8217;.</p>\n<p>As students of North American body language, we instinctively nodded our heads ‘yes’ and shook our heads side to side to signify ‘no’, even while remembering that Bulgarians do precisely the opposite. In Bulgaria, a side-to-side shake or head wobble signifies ‘yes’, while the up-down nod means ‘no.’ This made the conversation ever the more confusing and lighthearted, and all we could do was laugh. Even the Bulgarian grannies chuckled, causing the wooden bench on which they were sitting to shake.</p>\n<p>We continued on to the diminutive market just down the dusty street from the babas. With its packed shelves and attendant behind the counter waiting to fulfill our order, the setting evoked images of American general stores of decades bygone. Delightful Pippa, whom we’d come to know over the coming weeks, was curious why we were in Kalofer, a destination that tends to attract more domestic visitors than international ones. She concluded that we must be students learning Bulgarian. From that moment on, she played the role of language instructor extraordinaire, teaching us how to order yogurt, milk, and white-brine cheese (<em>kiselo mljako</em>, <em>mljako</em>, and <em>sirenje)</em>. The vocabulary for such staples as bell peppers and bread (<em>chushkis</em> and <em>hleb</em>) would come later.</p>\n<p>As we headed back to our guesthouse, we saw a curious lady peering down at us from her second-story window. She had snow-white hair that was wispy, like a wand of cotton candy. We waved and exchanged smiles.</p>\n<p>The next night, the same woman, whom we’d come to know as ‘Baba Maria’ or Grandmother Maria was sitting outside her neighbor’s gate, along the sidewalk on a hilly street. We still had just a smattering of words with which to communicate. Nevertheless, within seconds, we were smiling, laughing, and gesticulating. After half an hour of banter, Baba Maria and her neighbors were showering us with surprise gifts that were handcrafted and homemade.</p>\n<p>First, came a pair of cream-colored wool slippers, lovingly made by Baba Maria. Baba Maria motioned for me to remove my sandals, and slip the woolen socks on. She looked pleased, but not perfectly content. As an expert seamstress I think she observed that they were just a tad too large.</p>\n<p>With mischievous grins, her female neighbors then brought out a jar of homemade pear preserves, distinctly spiced with cloves. Next, Baba Maria instructed the ladies to snip off some of the fuchsia-colored Phlox flowers growing in their front yard, so that they could craft us a bouquet.</p>\n<p>Touched by their kindness, but eager to sneak away before they bestowed more thoughtful trinkets upon us, we prepared to head home.</p>\n<p>But there was more hospitality to be extended before we could escape. Baba Maria, who we learned to be in her early 80s, proudly presented us with a half-liter water bottle. With a twinkle in her eye, she exclaimed, “<em>Rakija</em>.”</p>\n<p>Rakija is homemade moonshine, a brandy made with everything from plums, to grapes, and even walnuts. Having spent several months in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, we knew that Rakija could pack a powerful punch.</p>\n<p>Baba Maria took off the plastic lid and encouraged us to take a sip. She carefully watched our expressions as we tossed the lids full of high-proof alcohol into our mouths. With our tongues on fire, we tried valiantly to flash the widest of grins.</p>\n<p>“<em>Dobro!</em>” We smiled as we tried to fan the flames inside our mouths.</p>\n<p>Baba Maria pointed to the bottle, then to herself. She wanted to be sure that we knew that she’d crafted the Rakija herself.</p>\n<p>By the time we left Kalofer about five weeks later, Baba Maria, wanting to be sure I had slippers with the perfect fit, had made three more pairs for me. They ranged in hues from baby-pink and red, to winter white. Xristina, her neighbor with a penchant for making the delectable clove preserves, even knitted Shawn a pair of earthy brown socks that came up to his calf, thus ensuring his toes were warm in winters ahead.</p>\n<p>Our hearts swelled from being the recipients of such generosity. And, suffice it to say that our mouths were ablaze at least once more when presented with a second bottle of Rakija from the ladies, followed by a third from our guesthouse hosts.</p>\n<p>Some nights, we chatted with Baba Maria’s neighbors while watching the town’s dance troupe practice traditional Bulgarian steps. The men and women of all ages held hands as they twirled in a circle. Sometimes, they looked as though they were in deep concentration, making sure to get the fanciful footwork just right. But mostly, they laughed easily and smiled. Whenever we saw this practice, I always left with a warm feeling in my heart because of the lovely sense of community that we had just witnessed.</p>\n<p>Another evening, we encountered a gentleman on a residential street. He saw that we were amused by his goats, which were nibbling on bushes cascading over a fence onto the sidewalk. He made a beeline for his pear trees, snipped off a few plump specimens, and handed them to us. We never saw him again, but we haven’t forgotten his thoughtful gesture, nor those flavorful pears.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Greeting Kalofer&#8217;s &#8216;Kids&#8217; As They Come Home</h3>\n<p>A dispatch on Kalofer would not be complete without mentioning the daily goat processions. When we first arrived in town, we noticed goats walking unattended on the streets at sunset. Stopping at a home’s gate, they nudged it with their heads until someone answered it. We learned later that this ritual really was the ‘kids’ coming home.</p>\n<p>Taken under the wing of new German-Bulgarian friends Elena and Poldi, we were invited to watch the evening goat procession. Together, on the outskirts of town, we met a cluster of goat owners who had gathered to greet their goats.</p>\n<p>Each morning, Elena and Poldi explained, a Kalofer goatherder would collect his charges and take them out into the surrounding hillsides to graze. He was responsible for about 300 goats, and earned roughly 3 <em>Lev</em> (USD $1.75) as payment, per goat, per month.</p>\n<p>As if there was a dust devil or impending tornado, the dirt soon swirled in the air as the hooves of several hundred goats hit the road. Amazingly, the goats were able to recognize their masters who had come to greet them. Those who didn’t have owners waiting for them, continued on to their respective homes. There, a nudge of a gate would signify to their owners that they were home, ready to come in for an evening feast.</p>\n<p>After watching the goat procession, Elena and Poldi took us to their cousins’ home so that we could watch their goats being milked. The cousins, Elena and Xristo, told us that one goat could produce about a liter (roughly a quarter of a gallon) of milk a day.</p>\n<p>Cousins Elena and Xristo then treated us to a feast of traditional Bulgarian fare: the ubiquitous <em>Shopska Salad</em> (diced cucumbers, tomatoes and white-brine cheese), a rice and pork dish, <em>Banitsa</em> (bread stuffed with cheese) and <em>Lokum</em>-filled pastries. The pièce de résistance was goat jerky flambée, which created a dramatic nighttime dish. Of course, Rakija and homemade wine also made prominent appearances at the table.</p>\n<p>As the evening wore on, Cousin Elena sang songs attesting to Kalofer’s past as a rose-oil producing town. The lyrics described pretty petals and plump apples floating down the stream, and the perfume of roses in the air. Sadly, those factories have since closed, leaving Kalofer and much of Bulgaria still developing. However, the ladies’ heartfelt singing carried us back to a gentler time in Kalofer’s history.</p>\n<p>Such acts of hospitality would continue, much due to the thoughtful introductions that our Bulgarian-German friends made to help us feel welcome in the community. We’d met Elena and Poldi because of their charismatic pooch, François, a boisterous French Bulldog. Following this sidewalk meeting, Elena and Poldi had swiftly invited us into their home to show off renovation projects. This mini tour was followed by an impromptu feast, and a sharing of photographs, while the dialogue was mostly in German. As the night wore on, a violent storm swept through the village, causing the electricity to go out for hours. This didn’t dampen the mood of our spontaneous feast; instead, Poldi used their laptop and candles to illuminate their dining room so that we could see each other’s faces.</p>\n<p>We stayed at our new friends’ home until just after midnight, making the walk home on streets filled with branches disrupted by the powerful storm. On the way home, we also discovered that some of Kalofer’s loose dogs were not as hospitable – rather many were quite intimidating as they guarded the streets in front of their homes. On this night, I was so frightened by a pair of very vocal, aggressive dogs that I prepared to hop onto a vehicle for safety. Fortunately, Shawn was able to use his booming voice to keep the animals at bay. This incident made us happy that we’d had our rabies shots, and we vowed to never again stay out so late.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">A Weaving Lesson &amp; &#8216;The Rear Window&#8217;</h3>\n<p>Aside from daily goat and cow processions and free-roaming dogs, we also witnessed vignettes reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film, <em>The Rear Window</em>. Instead of being able to see the comings and goings of urban dwellers in New York City, we were regularly privy to the happenings in village residents’ homes.</p>\n<p>Next door to our second guesthouse, for example, our balcony overlooked a backyard filled with chickens, two pigs, and a protective dog. We watched each morning as the household’s female resident put fresh helpings of food and water inside the pigs’ pen. She and her husband didn’t seem to have any interactions with the pigs, and when we saw meat hooks hanging on an adjacent support, we understood why. Though I do eat poultry and fish and I realize that it’s hypocritical for me to be sensitive about the prospect of seeing animals killed, I also felt thankful that we were not in that apartment when it came time to witness the slaughter of that pair of pigs.</p>\n<p>Not long before our departure from Kalofer, we were invited to the home of Daniela, a former dental assistant eager to begin a weaving business specializing in making rugs featuring Kalofer’s traditional patterns.</p>\n<p>Greeting us with a shot of Rakija and a dessert of candied plums in syrup, Daniela proudly showed us her newest acquisition – a wooden loom so massive that it consumed an entire room. Woodworm holes in the rich wood, paired with Daniela’s anecdotes, told us that this loom had an impressive history. Daniela said that she’d purchased it from Kalofer’s convent, and that it was likely 100 years old.</p>\n<p>Daniela pointed out that her first carpet would take about two weeks to complete. Once she became more confident on the loom, however, she expected to be able to weave one carpet per week.</p>\n<p>With our German-Bulgarian friends translating German into Bulgarian and vice versa, we answered Daniela’s questions about how to best market her creations. On a subsequent visit, Daniela, ever the gracious hostess, prepared a veritable smorgasbord of treats. Her selection included: a pudding dessert made from rice, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and tender, steamed zucchini; Banitsa bread; and homemade jam produced with apples, apricots and plums from Daniela’s own garden.</p>\n<p>As we said our farewells and walked out Daniela&#8217;s front door, she placed a tiny wooden vessel containing Bulgaria’s prized rose oil into my hands. It was wrapped in a decorative handkerchief that bore the image of a Bulgarian maiden in colorful dress, picking a basket of rose petals.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Time to Say Goodbye</h3>\n<p>After two wonderful months in Kalofer, it came time to bid farewell to the people that had treated us with such kindness and generosity. While sad to leave the tiny town, we were eager to explore more of the country. We’d already seen its capital, Sofia, and Plovdiv, but we also wanted to make stops in Veliko Turnovo, and two Black Sea cities.</p>\n<p>En route to Kalofer’s bus stop on that last day, we were met by Elena and Poldi. Elena ran into her garden to gather a small bouquet of herbs as a farewell gesture.</p>\n<p>“This is a tradition in Bulgaria,” she explained. Keep the bouquet watered in your train’s cabin, and beside your bed tonight at your new hotel. The herb will keep you calm and relaxed.”</p>\n<p>Elena and Poldi were insistent about paying our bus fare to the train station, since they’d not been able to personally escort us there in their own car.</p>\n<p>With sentimental memories of animals processions, and dinners illuminated by lightning or sizzling goat flambée now swirling in our minds, we bid farewell to our new friends and to Kalofer. At the train station, we would be greeted by a new trio of stray dogs, and within moments we were watching Kalofer’s lavender and sunflower-filled valley get smaller and smaller through a cabin window dressed with raindrops.</p>\n<p>Kalofer and her residents had given us exactly what we had been seeking, and we hope we can someday repay their kindness to other international visitors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://triciaannemitchell.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/kalofer-bulgaria-horse-and-wagon-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65750\" src=\"https://triciaannemitchell.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/kalofer-bulgaria-horse-and-wagon-2.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"Kalofer Bulgaria Horse and Wagon 2\"   /></a></p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_69030\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://triciaannemitchell.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/statue-of-hristo-botev-kalofer-bulgaria.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-69030 size-full\" src=\"https://triciaannemitchell.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/statue-of-hristo-botev-kalofer-bulgaria.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"Statue of Hristo Botev, Kalofer, Bulgaria\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kalofer&#8217;s distinctive statue of Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian national hero, poet, and revolutionary.

At the former, we enjoyed Tony and Stefan&#8217;s home&#8217;s stunning forest views, and pretty garden courtyard. The couple even took the time to show us <a title=\"A Lesson in Making Yogurt in Kalofer, Bulgaria\" href=\"http://triciaannemitchell.com/2014/07/23/how-to-make-yogurt-recipe-bulgarian-yogurt/\" target=\"_blank\">how to make Bulgarian yogurt</a>. At the latter guesthouse, we appreciated Stoyan&#8217;s and his family&#8217;s warm hospitality, and their willingness to introduce us to Kalofer residents who shared aspects of Bulgarian culture with us (<a title=\"The Snowflake-Like Lace of Kalofer, Bulgaria\" href=\"http://triciaannemitchell.com/2014/09/07/kalofer-lace-bulgaria/\" target=\"_blank\">lace-making</a> and <em>rakija</em>-distilling). The family also shared a bounty of plump, home-grown tomatoes with us, which we joyfully included in the Shopska Salads that we feasted upon several times per week.</li>\n<li>Kalofer has an an ATM machine, as well as an assortment of small, family-owned grocery stores where you can purchase food and essentials. A friendly vendor also sells fresh fruit and vegetable at a single stand (near the bus stop) which we regularly frequented during the summer months. On Thursdays, there&#8217;s a larger outdoor market where multiple vendors offer produce, and homemade goods such as honey and liqueur. For a larger range of grocery-shopping options, we took a bus to Karlovo, a significantly larger town of about 25,000 people.</li>\n<li>For more details about Kalofer&#8217;s ecotrail, lodging options, and annual Lace Festival, see the <a title=\"Kalofer website\" href=\"http://www.kalofer.com/index_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\">village&#8217;s website</a>.</li>\n<li>Since so many of the signs and written material are only written in the <a title=\"Cyrillic script - Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyrillic script</a>, it&#8217;s helpful to acquire a basic understanding of it before you go. During long bus rides, I passed some of the time by sounding out road signs (some written in both Cyrillic script and the Latin alphabet) and this helped out later when we were stumped trying to decipher street signs or railroad time tables. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></li>\n<li>Need more inspiration?

So I decided to go ahead and get the awkwardness of not being introduced to someone who is clearly there out of the way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This strange delusional creature who stands before you&#8230; this&#8230;this is Future Me.<a href=\"https://problemswithoo.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/img_0058.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1109\" src=\"https://problemswithoo.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/img_0058.jpg?w=585&#038;h=608\" alt=\"IMG_0058\"   /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Future Me is a character ever present in my life. She is my hope, my dreams, my naive eager zealousy and blind optimism that gets me into terrible situations.  She is the good to my evil.  She is my nemesis, and I her ever present villain, laying waste to all her poorly thought out intentions. She is an idiot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://problemswithoo.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/fin1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1071\" src=\"https://problemswithoo.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/fin1.jpg?w=585&#038;h=524\" alt=\"fin1\"   /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Future me is forever looking at the positive side of life, and forever attempting to solve my life problems with ridiculous solutions.  She doesn&#8217;t really understand that Present Me is a lazy asshole who likes to sit around eating waffles and throwing things at people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Instead, she is utterly convinced that together we&#8217;re some sort of superhero duo who can achieve anything in life.  Because of this naive insanity, Future Me is constantly tricking me into doing things that I hate so that maybe together we can lead a more functional life, and maybe, just maybe, I won&#8217;t continue to match her blind optimism with failure after failure.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I&#8217;ll be happily eating brownies and thinking of things I hate, when out of nowhere she&#8217;ll come up with an idea.  And with the patience of a starving adolescent howler monkey on fire, she&#8217;ll thrust the idea at me with a burst of overwhelming misplaced ambition so powerful and with such desperation that I can&#8217;t possibly say no.  She&#8217;s so, so, so pathetically hopeful.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And even though deep down I know that she&#8217;s an idiot and these ideas she comes up with are terrible, I am never strong-willed enough to deny her these fantasies.  </span></p>\n<h2>Examples of Future Me Getting Me Into Terrible Situations:</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Future Me:</strong> Let&#8217;s sign up for a marathon!

			"content": "<p>I&#8217;m currently writing this at 11.30pm, in the garden, where a fairly stiff breeze is blowing. This is the only place I know I won&#8217;t run to the baby if he cries (Robert is in the house with him, in case you think I&#8217;ve just left him). I&#8217;ve wanted to get some thoughts down about motherhood for months, but it&#8217;s been rather hard to write. Not just due to the new occupant of my lap. But because my feelings are hurricaning through me and evolving every day.</p>\n<p>When I was pregnant, I finally kicked a nasty, expensive habit that garnered me more than my fair share of tuts and frowns.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_17441\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://thesecretlifeofamanicdepressive.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/trashmags.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-17441\" src=\"https://thesecretlifeofamanicdepressive.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/trashmags.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"Bad for your health. And your vocabulary. \" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bad for your health. And your vocabulary.</p></div>\n<p>Part of the reason I read these exploitative trashmags is that I love peoples&#8217; stories. I don&#8217;t think anything is banal. When I was pregnant, I would walk down the street with a person in my body (!!!), thinking, &#8220;And this will be you&#8221;. The fact that he would be walking down a street lost in his own thought was absolutely mindboggling to me. I find it endlessly fascinating that there&#8217;s a story behind every face, that every person dwells within their own private universe.  In a way, there&#8217;s nothing more ordinary, and nothing more amazing.</p>\n<p>In January, Eva Wiseman wrote an article in the Guardian- <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/04/seismic-changes-of-having-baby-eva-wiseman\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;The seismic changes of having a baby&#8221;. </a>I read it when it was linked by various Facebook friends. The consensus being, &#8220;Big deal. Woman has baby shocker&#8221;. Commentary on how self obsessed her article was. Big deal indeed.</p>\n<p>Something isn&#8217;t less special, less beautiful, because it&#8217;s commonplace. Every day is filled with unfathomable, unpredictable ordinariness. Dreams, seasons, love. And grief isn&#8217;t less black and deep and consuming because it&#8217;s something that happens to everyone, every day, everywhere. Nobody (well, I hope not) tuts and rolls their eyes and says, &#8220;Big deal. People die everyday&#8221;. So why do we do it when people are born? Why, outside the climatic yet somehow bland scenes of a romcom, is it less amazing?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a peculiarly misogynistic view to hold, this woman&#8217;s world of babies and childbirth. How dull, how droll. How very trivial. From woman to mummy, from one judgement to another. (I saw a tweet from a supposed feminist about another feminist, scorning an article they&#8217;d written sarcastically saying, &#8220;Did she mention she&#8217;s a mother?&#8221; I blocked her). Women across the world are judged on their status as a mother, or potential mother. Being a, &#8220;real&#8221; woman is partly judged by your attitude towards or your ability to reproduce.  Our reproductive capacity is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of being female.  It&#8217;s when domestic violence often starts or intensifies. It&#8217;s a visible, very visceral sign of your sexual activity. You can die because of it- through pregnancy, through childbirth, or through not being able to have a baby. Women are murdered because of it, women kill themselves over it. And the first year postpartum is one of the riskiest periods in a woman&#8217;s life- where suicide is the biggest killer. Yeah, this shit matters. This is not trivial.   The people I&#8217;ve spoken to most about parenthood have been men. It&#8217;s applauded for the dads to say how amazing it is to have a child, but for mothers, there&#8217;s ridicule. So what.</p>\n<p>I can understand a distaste of the oddly consumerist and competitive side of parenthood. Who&#8217;s having the &#8220;easiest&#8221; pregnancy, to the easy baby, to the best pram, the milestones. That&#8217;s trivial. But sharing these things is part of the culture of parenthood. Part of life itself.  Sharing the darker aspects- feeding problems, illness, relationship problems, postnatal mental health, postnatal physical health, sexuality, the huge shake up of your identity, your body, your mind (hormones are real fuckers), wifework and the distribution of labour and for some, regret- is only just beginning to find the light. And so it should. As I said, this shit matters. Motherhood is a feminist issue.</p>\n<p>The whole experience has stripped me down and shaken up my values. I love my job, I care about my job, and I never thought for a second I&#8217;d not want to go back to work. I used to joke that I&#8217;d leave the maternity ward and go to the pub.  But I would happily stay off to look after the baby.  And the Daily Mail would write that shit as, &#8220;How Women Are Turning On their Careers for Babies&#8221;. Which is bullshit. I&#8217;m going back to work, and I&#8217;m not a different person. This is a new part of me, a new spoke on the wheel.  It&#8217;s frustrating sometimes, exhausting often, but I never knew how easily it would come to love someone, to do those frustrating, exhausting things. How fulfulling it would feel to change a pooey nappy because it means I could kiss his toes and make him laugh, and how much joy I&#8217;d get in those tired hours. I had prepared myself for &#8220;not feeling it&#8221;. People warned me about it. After all, it makes sense. Here&#8217;s a person you&#8217;ve never met, you don&#8217;t really know, who, for a while, can&#8217;t give much back. It might take time to love them. And it did- about 10 hours. And since then my love has grown and grown to strain my heart against my chest, to spill into the world, to everyone in it.</p>\n<p>And it frightens me. It terrifies me. Throughout pregnancy, I consciously tried not to connect. I felt at every stage I could lose it, and he could die. I tried to protect myself by keeping myself at a distance. Which is very hard when the distance goes as far as inside yourself.  In the quieter moments with Robert on his nightshift I&#8217;d play him songs (him! It was him all along in there) and talk to him and feel his kicks in response. And it got harder and harder not to connect when I&#8217;d have my panicked morning frappucino (cold and caffeine, the perfect way to get your baby to move) and he&#8217;d give me a few pissed off kicks. But it was terror, almost constant terror.</p>\n<p>I feel the same terror, mingled with bliss, never a hope of separating one from the other. I&#8217;ve sat, so many nights, with his downy head under my chin and cried over it. My fear of death has come back tenfold, because the absolute best case scenario is that I won&#8217;t see how my son&#8217;s life pans out. (Did my dad feel this way about us before he died anyway?) From both me and Robert, and through both me and Robert, there will come that inevitable terminal separation. Forever and forever from the one who I grew with my body. And that we will break his heart one day, and mine breaks over and over again.</p>\n<p>Now my life seems to be measured in his days and weeks and months and years, and not my own. And it feels so very small. The grief is raw, and I try to centre myself. I grieve each clothes size, each little thing that was there that&#8217;s already gone- gone! forever! The way he&#8217;d sigh after finishing a bottle. Moro! Squealing with delight at Saturday in the Very Hungry Caterpillar. Not being able to reach Monkeys in his bouncy chair. Being so tiny, and now not so tiny.  I used to think babies were hams. That&#8217;s the word I used- they&#8217;re angry and pink and wibbling. But every day! he does something new. He&#8217;s babbling now, giving us long lectures in his language we&#8217;re only beginning to understand. He rolled over this week and was so shocked he burst into tears. First, a second of silence, then he caught my eye and his lip began to wobble. I picked him up and called to Robert upstairs. This week, he also stroked a cat. He&#8217;s just noticing them, particularly fascinated by their hovering question mark tails. I held his hand- his tiny hand- and pressed it onto her fur. He unfurled his fist and began to laugh- a belly laugh (I understand that phrase now, as I held him he bellowed, and I understand that one, too). And it was utterly beautiful. This little moment of discovery in the world, and as near to death I feel I am sometimes, I am born, again.</p>\n<p>That probably sounds evangelical, and I am, in a way. I can see why people worship their children.It&#8217;s okay to, as people. The problem is when we see them as extensions of ourselves, which they aren&#8217;t. From the second they&#8217;re born, they&#8217;re their own person. Which is frightening in itself, with all that being a person entails. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to cope the first time someone&#8217;s horrible to him. When he&#8217;s hurt or disappointed. For the first few weeks I was afraid to take him to places I wasn&#8217;t sure were child friendly as I knew I&#8217;d disintegrate if I saw a tut, or someone mumbling about bloody kids. They&#8217;re part of our lives, part of our society. There are some places they don&#8217;t belong (we tried to take him to someone&#8217;s birthday dinner, thinking it&#8217;d be sedate, but I was on the train home 30 minutes later) but that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n<p>Another reason why I cry is his childness makes me ache for mine. In as much as he makes me wonder and look at the world anew, my small self is huddled inside, nerves as exposed as my heart feels. When he cries- from hunger, or fear, or loneliness- I feel the fear and loneliness of my own childhood. I rush to make it right, to put arms around the lonely one, to wipe away the tears and soothe the fear. And now I feel every child&#8217;s fear and it means I can&#8217;t watch or read as much as I used to. It causes me physical pain. I find myself crying at the big things- news reports- and the small, FUCKING ADVERTS. (Fucking meerkat bastards). I feel like a layer of my skin has been sloughed off, and sometimes, I want the hardness back. Give me back my cynicism (it&#8217;s still there, somewhere). It&#8217;s agonising sometimes. Sometimes too much.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not always walking around in a blissful daze. He can do my head in, too. The sheer relentlessness of it is a shock. This person (person!) is utterly dependent on you and it&#8217;s so daunting. And grinding. I miss the days of not worrying whether cot death has taken him (my head plays these awful scenarios, screaming), or worrying that something else will (please don&#8217;t take him, take me instead). Today, he was driving me up the wall. He&#8217;s going through a Baby Phase, you know, baby stuff. More of the mindblasting world to make sense of. I set my alarm so I could be there when he woke up (as Robert sleeps with him, not me, due to medication). He gave me this gorgeous smile and started kicking his legs excitedly and laughing. Which was a good start. And proceeded to go through the day refusing to nap, going on baby lectures, hating to be held, wanting to be held then hating it, lots of bottles, and a three hour battle to get him to sleep. Then he does that thing- that melty heart thing which is why you eventually don&#8217;t care, have a second wind and want the whiny exhaustion to last forever. A three hour bedtime and finally get him to lie down, pick up a book and he coos in anticipation, holds his hand out for me to hold, giggles and makes cute noises with rapt attention the whole way through. Then a few songs which he smiles at so much I gave up with his dummy. Lie next to him and he sleepily gazes into my eyes and rests his little hand on my cheek. What a babe.  This was the book.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thesecretlifeofamanicdepressive.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/book.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17479\" src=\"https://thesecretlifeofamanicdepressive.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/book.jpg?w=480&#038;h=255\" alt=\"book\"   /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s given me more love for everyone, and unlikely allies have emerged. People I didn&#8217;t know really cared have been on the end of Twitter, Facebook, a phone, with blankets, toys, little hats, clothes. He&#8217;s bedecked in the love and the kindnesses of others, and it&#8217;s beautiful. He&#8217;s an adored and doted on nephew and grandchild. It&#8217;s given me a new love for my husband, too. He was amazing throughout my pregnancy, throughout the labour, and he&#8217;s a wonderful father. Utter, utter gentleness and love, and pride. Watching them together is a delight. Just him talking- about any old thing- makes Oisín giggle and whoop with delight. He smiles so broadly when he sees him, they adore each other. Robert&#8217;s better than me at taking him out, he shows him the world, shares with him so many things. He&#8217;s going to be the stay at home dad, and it&#8217;ll be hard. The whole stay at home thing isn&#8217;t set up for fathers. But what a role model he will be. He&#8217;s just a baby, just a child, but the world will try to teach him he&#8217;s a boy, and what a boy is supposed to be. And Robert will be there to teach him that a boy can be gentle, and kind, and loving, silly and emotional, as so many boys are, but told they shouldn&#8217;t be. He will grow up with the very best boy to teach him. And I hope I can do teach him well, too.</p>\n<p>So, my little baby, when you can read, and if you ever read this, I love the hell out of you. Sorry for the sort of swear word but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have heard a lot of those by now. It&#8217;s because you&#8217;re half Irish, and this is our punctuation. And I&#8217;ll love you, whoever you are (and I&#8217;m getting an idea, my curious, giggly, reachy little Bean) and whatever you do. Nothing you do will ever make me not love you. You&#8217;re pretty ace. Now go back to sleep. xxx</p>\n<p>Edit: for some reason this post is showing as May 18th. I wrote it on June 11, so go figure!</p>\n",

			"content": "<p>I start teaching summer camp in a week, and because my bosses are supportive and (usually) say yes when I ask for things, I now have a few precious dollars at my disposal to spend on books.</p>\n<p>Specifically, books for my students to use as a springboard for a design project. I love this assignment: I ask my students, ages 8-15, to read a classic children&#8217;s book and then design the sets, props, costumes, lights, and sounds that they would create, if they had huge resources and could dream big. I love seeing how their brains have translated beloved stories into concrete ideas: <em>Snow White,</em> <em>Charlotte&#8217;s Web</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>. I howled with delight the year that my older teens gave me their take on <em>Robin Hood</em>, influenced by too many action films and a vague understanding of the financial crisis; some of the costume designs for <em>James and the Giant Peach</em> were imaginative and playful in a way some working professionals might envy.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s face it: you can&#8217;t phone in the same stuff every year. You need new material, and so I started researching children&#8217;s books. My initial qualifications:</p>\n<p>&#8211; It must be FUN. This is summer camp. I&#8217;m not making them slog through anything that feels like school.</p>\n<p>-It must be FUNNY. This is mostly just personal preference: I&#8217;m passionate about comedy and I love very few things more than a kid getting the belly-laugh-snort-giggles.</p>\n<p>&#8211; It must be DESIGNABLE. Something with characters that kids could design costumes for, something with locations that kids would enjoy creating sets for, etc.</p>\n<p>&#8211; It must be UNIVERSAL. Something that my eight-year-olds can read and understand, but that won&#8217;t seem too babyish for my fifteen-year-olds.</p>\n<p>Okay. So far, so good! The titles began to stack up: <em>The Paper Bag Princess! </em>Added to cart. A princess outwits a dragon, learns that appearances are not as important as character, and decides that she&#8217;s rather not be saved by a stuck-up, vain prince after all. <em>Meet the Dullards! </em>Flavors of Roald Dahl, but for the picture-book crowd, where a boring set of parents bent on beige walls and sliced-bread values can&#8217;t seem to repress their children&#8217;s urges to draw with crayons or imagine the circus. A whole slew of amazing, funny, wild and wonderful books featuring animal or other non-human protagonists: the Pigeon books, Skippyjon Jones, Max in Hollywood, baby! The Day the Crayons Quit!</p>\n<p>And then I took a break from this research project to look at the news, and that was when I realized my mistake.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Fifteen year old Dajerria Becton was thrown to the ground by an armed police officer this weekend in the small Texas suburb of McKinney, her arms pinned behind her, her face slammed to the ground. A man named Eric Casebolt knelt with his knees on top of her as she screamed, as he sweat through his gear, moments after ducking and rolling and screaming with all the severity of the final scene of any action movie, moments after drawing a loaded gun on some teenaged boys. <a href=\"http://heavy.com/news/2015/06/eric-casebolt-mckinney-texas-police-officer-cop-suspended-black-teens-pool-party-arrest-video-leave-investigation-photo-gun-background-name/\" target=\"_blank\">Click another news site</a>, and you&#8217;ll get another opinion: endless debate about whether the teenagers were allowed to be in the gated community in the first place, whether or not there was weed and loud music involved in the disturbance complaint, whether or not the incident was racially motivated.</p>\n<p>The last sentence is the one that hurts my heart to type, because you watch that video and &#8212; my god, of course it&#8217;s racially motivated. The white kids are milling around, filming on their phones, virtually ignored. The black kids are handcuffed, thrown down, screamed at to get their asses on the ground. The country takes notice. We tweet, we facebook, we write, we think, we feel. Many people feel weary, exhausted. This is an old story. We&#8217;ve heard this one before.</p>\n<p>Eric Casebolt has resigned. It&#8217;s not enough. I don&#8217;t know what is, but it&#8217;s not enough. You don&#8217;t draw your gun at a group of teenagers at a pool party where you&#8217;re responding to a noise complaint. You don&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t draw your gun. At children. At a <strong>pool party. </strong></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>I read voraciously as a kid, and my favorites were stories about girls with a streak of rebellion and a taste for adventure: Harriet the Spy, Eloise, Mary Lennox, Sara Crewe, Matilda, Pippi Longstocking, Ella Enchanted, Catharine Called Birdy, Charlotte Doyle, Trixie Belden, Nancy Drew. Any of the girls in the E.L. Konigsburg or Zilpha Keatly Snyder books, who slept in museums or crafted seances; the girls created by Judy Blume, so vulnerable and so much like me. Entire series of women protagonists who got things done: The Boxcar Children and the Babysitters&#8217; Club and the American Girls.</p>\n<p>Girls who read, learned, climbed trees, fought back, solved mysteries, fell down, got back up, struggled, persevered. Girls who survived crazy hardships or learned valuable lessons.</p>\n<p>Girls who looked just like me. Brave girls. Smart girls. Funny girls.</p>\n<p>White girls.</p>\n<p>I read some books about black girls too, of course. I read a book about Harriet Tubman, and a book about Sojourner Truth, and a book about Phyllis Wheatley. Clara and the Freedom Quilt. Addy, the American Girl. I&#8217;m sure there must have been some Asian girls and Hispanic girls in there too, although I can&#8217;t recall any at the moment.</p>\n<p>In 2012, the <a href=\"http://blog.firstbook.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diversity_tinakugler.jpg\">Cooperative Children’s Book Center </a>reviewed 3,600 children’s books. Only three percent were about African-Americans. Asian and Pacific Americans were featured in two percent, followed by Latinos with less than two percent, and American Indians at less than one percent. I pulled those stats from a Washington Post article called <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/08/characters-in-childrens-books-are-almost-always-white-and-its-a-big-problem/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Characters in Children&#8217;s Books are Almost Always White, and it&#8217;s a Big Problem.&#8221; </a></p>\n<p>I put it out there on Facebook that I was seeking a children&#8217;s book featuring nonwhite protagonists, that was fun and funny, that was adaptable for the stage, that could be understood by eight-year-olds. And my smart, well-read friends turned in a trove of possibilities. So many excellent books! So many wonderful authors! But none of them seemed quite right.</p>\n<p>The funniest stories featured white kids, or non-human protagonists. The stories featuring nonwhite kids all felt rooted in some kind of &#8220;other&#8221; &#8212; stories about the civil rights movement, stories that were adapted from slave folk tales, stories about accepting natural hair as beautiful. Stories whose major plot points hinged on their blackness or their &#8220;other-ness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those stories are important, and those stories are necessary, and I am so glad those stories exist, and they should be created, and read, and put in the hands of children everywhere.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not quite enough.</p>\n<p>Why don&#8217;t I know a single laugh-out-loud funny children&#8217;s book where the main character is nonwhite and that fact has <em><strong>literally nothing to do</strong> with saving the day/climbing the tree/inventing the space robot/learning a valuable lesson? </em>After all, that&#8217;s stuff that white characters get to do in children&#8217;s books all the time. If you&#8217;re a white person, odds are that you&#8217;ve never consciously thought, &#8220;Huh. Cinderella is white, and so am I.&#8221; Because it has nothing to do with the story. We&#8217;ve never thought about her whiteness &#8217;cause it doesn&#8217;t matter. Nancy Drew was an intelligent, spunky teen with an eye for detail, and being white had nothing to do with her ability to solve mysteries and hang out in spooky caves. Matilda&#8217;s telekinetic powers had everything to do with her love of reading combined with her terrible home life; I&#8217;m far too busy thinking about getting revenge on the Trunchbull to consciously consider her skin tone.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s like <a href=\"http://iambeggingmymothernottoreadthisblog.com/2015/06/06/the-feminist-awakening-of-miss-piggy/\" target=\"_blank\">my post about Miss Piggy</a> from last week. Maybe having a nonwhite protagonist is the same as having a male protagonist: it complicates the joke. It&#8217;s the extra thing that we collectively can&#8217;t quite process yet. Maybe that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.</p>\n<p>But I can&#8217;t help but think that if we raise our kids on a steady diet of &#8220;these are stories about kids like you&#8221; and &#8220;these are stories about kids who are <em>almost</em> like you,&#8221; it&#8217;s got to be a contributing factor to the other-ness. A small drop in the bucket of a collective idea about what is normal and what is not.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it does seem like there are books out there that hit the mark. There&#8217;s &#8220;The Snowy Day,&#8221; by Ezra Jack Keats, where the main protagonist happens to be a black boy, and that fact has virtually nothing to do with a story about walking around discovering the wonder of snow. There&#8217;s &#8216;The Hello Goodbye Window&#8217; and &#8220;Stand Tall, Molly Lou Mellon,&#8221; both of which I will order on the recommendations of friends, because it seems like they might fit the bill. There&#8217;s a few others on that thread that I have to research a little more fully (and thank you, my Facebook friends, almost all of whom are my real-life friends: you are smart, thoughtful people and I treasure you).</p>\n<p>My point is that it shouldn&#8217;t take an enormous facebook thread to find them. My point is that I should have read these books already. My point is that maybe if you, like me, has a job or a life where you have access to children, then we all need to work a little harder to find those voices that represent other ideas. My students are primarily white, and it is my responsibility to find stories where the black students feel represented &#8212; because come to think of it, in the two years I&#8217;ve had this job, I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve done that before, and that makes me feel so deeply ashamed.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not only that, though. I want my white students to build their empathy skills. I want my white students to find a point of connection between them and someone who might not look like them. I want my white students to read stories about non-white kids and not think &#8220;black&#8221; or &#8220;Asian&#8221; but rather &#8220;clever,&#8221; &#8220;smart,&#8221; &#8220;funny,&#8221; &#8220;silly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I suspect that it looked weird to that police officer, to see a bunch of black teenagers hanging out by the pool in swimsuits. Perhaps this person was raised on a steady diet of seeing black teenagers labeled &#8220;thug&#8221; or &#8220;poor&#8221; or &#8220;disruptive&#8221; or &#8220;trouble.&#8221; Perhaps those messages crept in at an early age.</p>\n<p>I want to read stories with my kids where characters who aren&#8217;t white get to fight crime, solve mysteries, travel, explore, dream, dance, and grow. I want those characters to shine because they are awesome, not because they are other. I want them to get the giggles so hard they pee a little, and I want them to learn, on some critical subconscious level, that laughter is universal. That laughter is for everybody.</p>\n<p>Maybe someday, when we see a bunch of black teenagers hanging out, we won&#8217;t think &#8220;black.&#8221; We&#8217;ll think &#8220;teenager.&#8221; We&#8217;ll think, &#8220;I remember when I was that age.&#8221; We&#8217;ll think, &#8220;kids.&#8221;</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_4146\" style=\"width: 644px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://iambeggingmymothernottoreadthisblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-09-at-7-37-37-pm.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4146 size-full\" src=\"https://iambeggingmymothernottoreadthisblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-09-at-7-37-37-pm.png?w=480\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-06-09 at 7.37.37 PM\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This photo was pulled from @markusprimelives&#8217; Instagram.

I hope that someday it won&#8217;t look so jarring to our eyes, to see a young black woman striking a pose that we&#8217;d more commonly associate with Batman.</p></div>\n",

			"content": "<p>Last week I had the opportunity to catch up with and shoot the second member of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BytownChefsCollective\" target=\"_blank\">Bytown Chefs Collective</a> </strong>(BCC), Kyle Proulx, Head Chef at <a href=\"http://www.lowertownbrewery.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Lowertown Brewery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theweeklyminute.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/untitled-148.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9257\" src=\"https://theweeklyminute.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/untitled-148.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"kyle proulx\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I met up with Kyle at his new restaurant, Lowertown Brewery, in the uber-busy <a href=\"http://www.byward-market.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Byward Market</a> in downtown Ottawa. Lowertown Brewery is the latest addition to the Ontario craft beer scene, which has really become a major part of Ottawa. Literally working around the corner from his friend and Bytown Chefs Collective partner Paul Dubeau (<a href=\"https://theweeklyminute.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/chef-portraits-paul-dubeau/\" target=\"_blank\">my first shoot in the series</a>), Kyle&#8217;s restaurant and working style posed a stark contrast to Paul&#8217;s, which I think (and hope) help makes this series an interesting one.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-9260 size-full\" src=\"https://theweeklyminute.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/untitled-366.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"untitled-366\"   /></p>\n<p>In my first shoot at Stella, Paul&#8217;s kitchen was exactly what I imagined a restaurant kitchen to be &#8211; compact; efficient; hidden from view; and with the head chef at the centre of the action, calling orders and plating the dishes. Kyle&#8217;s kitchen however, was an enormous open concept; and set up so that Kyle faced the cook team, called out the orders, made finishing touches to the plates, and summoned the servers. Think of a quarterback at the line and you&#8217;ll get the gist.</p>\n<p>Kyle has an intensity that I don&#8217;t see in very many people. Many people at my age and younger seem to take life for granted and demand the riches without working for it. Kyle does not appear to be that type of young professional. As we talked and walked through the Market, I learned a bit about his background and how he got to where he is today. <a href=\"https://theweeklyminute.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/untitled-196.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-9262\" src=\"https://theweeklyminute.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/untitled-196.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" alt=\"kyle proulx rooftop\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>I can only imagine that to succeed in the restaurant industry you have to have your game face on at all times. You have to be aware of what&#8217;s going on around you, and you have to find ways to set yourself apart, especially in a densely populated restaurant location such as the Market in Ottawa. With smart phones tucked into the front pockets of their aprons, Kyle and the other members of the BCC show just how important social media and engagement are to their businesses. Without missing a step, these guys can prepare a dish while simultaneously sharing posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.</p>\n<p>Having said all that, Kyle has a great personality and a great gift for gab. He knows how to work hard, have fun, and entertain, and I look forward to seeing him in action with the Bytown Chefs Collective later this year. For now, here are two galleries from the shoot&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"480\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:33305091,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/theweeklyminute.wordpress.com\\/2015\\/06\\/10\\/chef-portraits-kyle-proulx\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:33305091}' > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 480px;

			"content": "<p>I am a black woman. I consider myself lucky that I chose a program that houses other black women, making me not the token for the first time in my experience of higher education. I chose a program that even has black men, and other types of people of color in it. I chose a program that has people in it who fight for the voices of marginalized populations as their daily bread, in and out of what they do for writing or for work.</p>\n<p>However, even paradise (which I consider my program to be) has its flaws. I came to the program brimming with enthusiasm, and ready to write. My first fiction workshop made me self-conscious. I was the only black woman in that class. I, coming from a predominantly white institution for undergrad, have been known to carry the weight of race. I felt conflicted. I didn’t want to submit something for workshop that was urban or street fiction. I felt that gritty urban fiction was something my peers expected me to be able to come up with. Instead, I wanted to try something new. This challenged me to write a piece about love and marriage after miscarriage.</p>\n<p>There were many times that I wanted to drop out of the program. I felt like I wasn’t being afforded the same opportunities. I felt like I wasn’t being heard. I felt like people weren’t actually reading my work in workshops. I felt like people kept asking arbitrary questions about authenticity because of my race. All of this happened in paradise. I stuck it out. I argued with people. I made myself be heard. It is exhausting always having to teach people. I don’t owe anyone anything. I don’t owe you an explanation about why your stereotypical portrayal of blacks in your piece didn’t wow me. At the same time, you don’t owe me an explanation of why you wrote it that way.</p>\n<p>Also, I noticed something about literature. There’s a lot of literature written about straight white males complaining. Some of it is brilliant and some of it isn’t. I see the tremendous value placed on this type of literature and I see the way other works by people of color or non-straight people are separated and categorized under headings. If you are a professor, please assign some variety in your readings. I’ve been blessed again with professors who have inundated me with various types of literature of all kinds but I know that’s not the case everywhere.</p>\n<p>Race, class, gender and sexuality are issues that carry a heavy weight. In my first class in the program, we were guessing scenarios based on dialogue in Playwriting and I offended someone. I argued that their piece was love between a man or a woman. She rolled her eyes and told me it was love between a woman and another woman. Further conversations with this woman have occurred. I told her that it was instilled in me, even as queer person, to think that love only happens between men and women. She told me that she felt that this program was very straight and that she was glad to know that there were more LGBT folk around than she had previously known.</p>\n<p>There are things that are instilled in us from childhood. There are things that are institutionalized and relegated as normal. Ask yourself before asking someone if their memoir piece is realistic or authentic enough—why am I asking that? Is it because they are of a different race or sexuality than me? Ask yourself, am I not reading this workshop piece because it makes me uncomfortable? Not acknowledging these issues will keep these problems resurfacing. Colorblind is still blind no matter how you spin it.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/7jA6z8\" target=\"_blank\">Image: Zhu</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">=========</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://themfayears.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/sf101.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-1752 alignleft\" src=\"https://themfayears.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/sf101.jpg?w=206&amp;h=274\" alt=\"\" width=\"206\" height=\"274\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sarah Francois is an MFA candidate at <a href=\"http://www.liu.edu/Brooklyn/Academics/Schools/College-of-Liberal-Arts-and-Sciences/Programs/Div1/English/MFA-CW\" target=\"_blank\">LIU Brooklyn</a>.
